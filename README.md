Detects and skips ads when the posting limit is reached (AOL detection)
Automatically clicks the "Save & Approve" button for valid ads
Provides a clear console summary for Approved, Skipped, and Failed ads
Supports multiple ad URLs for batch approval


Language:	Python 3.10+
Framework:	Playwright
Runtime:	AsyncIO

Project Structure:
auto_approve.py         # Main automation script
bikroy_login.json       # Saved browser session (auto-generated)
debug_limit_error_*.png # Debug screenshots for troubleshooting

Installation and Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bikroy-auto-approve.git
cd bikroy-auto-approve

Step 2: Install Dependencies
pip install playwright
playwright install

Step 3: Add Your Ad URLs
Edit the URLS list in auto_approve.py:

URLS = [
    "https://admin.bikroy.com/item/68f8b27a0659bc5fgdjytuii",
    "https://admin.bikroy.com/item/68f8b27a0659bc51sghtytt",
]

Usage:
First Run (Login Setup)

Run the script:
python auto_approve.py

When the browser opens, log in manually to the Bikroy Admin Dashboard.
Once logged in, return to the terminal and press ENTER.
Your session will be saved automatically in bikroy_login.json.
Subsequent Runs (Fully Automated)

The script will:
Check each adâ€™s posting limit
Skip ads when the limit is full
Click Save & Approve for the rest
The end summary will display:

Approved: X
Skipped (AOL): Y
Failed: Z

How It Works

Login Handling
Saves your Playwright browser session to avoid repeated login steps.

Limit Detection
Reads:
<span class="ui-bubble is-membership-limits">3 of 3 ads in Electronics Free</span>
If the current value equals the maximum (for example, 3 of 3), the ad is skipped automatically.

Approval Automation
If the limit is not full, the script locates and clicks the "Save & Approve" button.

Troubleshooting
If the console shows Limit bubble not found, increase the timeout or verify the selector.
If your login session expires, delete bikroy_login.json and run the login process again.
Debug screenshots (debug_limit_error_*.png) are saved automatically when errors occur.
