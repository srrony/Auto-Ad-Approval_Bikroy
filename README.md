Detects and skips ads when the posting limit is reached (AOL detection)

Automatically clicks the "Save & Approve" button for valid ads

Provides a clear console summary for Approved, Skipped, and Failed ads

Installation and Setup
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bikroy-auto-approve.git
cd bikroy-auto-approve

Step 2: Install Dependencies
pip install playwright
playwright install

Step 3: Add Your Ad URLs

Edit the URLS list in auto_approve.py:

URLS = [
    "https://admin.bikroy.com/item/68f8b27a0659bc5fgdjytuii",
    "https://admin.bikroy.com/item/68f8b27a0659bc51sghtytt",
]

Usage
First Run (Login Setup)

Run the script:

python auto_approve.py


When the browser opens, log in manually to the Bikroy Admin Dashboard.

Once logged in, return to the terminal and press ENTER.

Your session will be saved automatically in bikroy_login.json.

Subsequent Runs (Fully Automated)

The script will:

Check each adâ€™s posting limit

Skip ads when the limit is full

Click Save & Approve for the rest

The end summary will display:

Approved: X
Skipped (AOL): Y
Failed: Z

How It Works

Login Handling
Saves your Playwright browser session to avoid repeated login steps.

Limit Detection
Reads:

<span class="ui-bubble is-membership-limits">3 of 3 ads in Electronics Free</span>


If the current value equals the maximum (for example, 3 of 3), the ad is skipped automatically.

Approval Automation
If the limit is not full, the script locates and clicks the "Save & Approve" button.

Troubleshooting

If the console shows Limit bubble not found, increase the timeout or verify the selector.

If your login session expires, delete bikroy_login.json and run the login process again.

Debug screenshots (debug_limit_error_*.png) are saved automatically when errors occur.

Would you like me to add a GitHub Actions workflow so that you can run this automation automatically (for example, every morning or once per day)?

in configaration, do i need to select any python

Great question â€” yes, in VS Code youâ€™ll need to make sure itâ€™s using the correct Python interpreter before running your script.

Hereâ€™s exactly what to do:

Step-by-Step: Select the Python Interpreter in VS Code

Open VS Code and load your project folder (where auto_approve.py is saved).

Press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on macOS) to open the Command Palette.

Type:

Python: Select Interpreter


Press Enter, and youâ€™ll see a list of installed Python versions.

Choose the one you installed Playwright in â€” usually something like:

Python 3.10.11 64-bit (C:\Users\<yourname>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\python.exe)


Youâ€™ll see the selected interpreter name appear at the bottom-right corner of VS Code.

ðŸ§© Verify Playwright is installed in that environment

In VS Codeâ€™s integrated terminal (bottom panel), run:

python --version


Make sure it matches the version you selected.

Then install dependencies in that same environment:

pip install playwright
playwright install

 Tip: If youâ€™re using a virtual environment

If youâ€™ve created a virtual environment (for example, .venv):

python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate   # on Windows
source .venv/bin/activate  # on macOS/Linux


Then select that .venv environment in VS Code via
Python: Select Interpreter â†’ .venv

Once thatâ€™s done, you can simply hit Run  at the top-right of VS Code (or press F5),
and the script will launch correctly using the chosen Python interpreter.
